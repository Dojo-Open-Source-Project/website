## Verify PGP signature


Verify the PGP signed fingerprints file:

```sh
  gpg --verify samourai-dojo-1.27.0-fingerprints.txt.sig

```
gpg: Signature made [date + time]
gpg: using EDDSA key E53AD419B242822F19E23C6D3033D463D6E544F6
gpg: Good signature from "dojocoder@pm.me" <dojocoder@pm.me> [unknown]
You can safely ignore the following if displayed:

gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
You may continue to the next step in this guide.
```

### ❌ Unsuccessful result

If you observe a different result to the above, **stop immediately**. Do not continue following this guide. Do not install Dojo. Seek advice from a community member.

## Verify SHA256 fingerprints

Verify the SHA256 fingerprints of the downloaded file:
```sh
sha256sum --check samourai-dojo-1.27.0-fingerprints.txt --ignore-missing
```

### ✅ Successful result
Successful verification is confirmed if the following is displayed on screen:

```
samourai-dojo-1.27.0.zip: OK

### ❌ Unsuccessful result

Unsuccessful verification might be displayed on screen:

```

sha256sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match
sha256sum: samourai-dojo-1.27.0-fingerprints.txt: no file was verified
