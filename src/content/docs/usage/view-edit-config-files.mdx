title: Viewing and editing configuration files
---

After you have installed Dojo, you may have a need to view your existing configuration files (e.g. if you want to copy one of your admin credentials), or you may want to edit a configuration file to configure your Dojo for a more advanced setup.

This guide does not provide details of how to go about setting configurations files for specific advanced Dojo setups, only how you would go about editing/saving configuration files, then how to apply the changes.

In the terminal of your Dojo, copy and paste the following commands, then press `ENTER`.

## How to view configuration files
### Navigate to the configuration files directory
```sh
cd ~/dojo-app/docker/my-dojo/conf/
```
This is the directory where all Dojo configuration (conf) files are stored. All the following commands are to be run in this directory.

### View bitcoind conf
```sh
cat docker-bitcoind.conf
```
### View common conf
```sh
cat docker-common.conf
```
### View explorer conf
```sh
cat docker-explorer.conf
```
### View indexer conf
```sh
cat docker-indexer.conf
```
### View mysql conf
```sh
cat docker-mysql.conf
```
### View node conf
```sh
cat docker-node.conf
```
### View tor conf
```sh
cat docker-tor.conf
```

## How to edit configuration files
**Note**: This guide only applies if you have already installed Dojo.

### Navigate to the configuration files directory
```sh
cd ~/dojo-app/docker/my-dojo/conf/
```
This is the directory where all Dojo configuration (conf) files are stored.

### Open the configuration file in the editor
Run the following command, substituting in the name of the configuration file you wish to edit:

```sh
nano docker-ConfigurationFileNameHere.conf
```
For example:

```sh
nano docker-indexer.conf
```

### Make your desired edits
Continue to make edits to the configuration file which you hare opened in the editor.

#### Top tips for editing configuration files
- Do not use your mouse
- Use your keyboard `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `HOME`, and `END` buttons to navigate
- Use your keyboard BACKSPACE button to delete text
- Paste using `ctrl + shift + v`
- If you make a mistake, go:
    - `ctrl + x`
    - then press `n`
    - then press `ENTER`
    - then enter the "nano" command into the terminal to try again

### Save and exit the configuration file
Type the following into your keyboard:

- `ctrl + x`
- then press `y`
- then press `ENTER`
¨
### Navigate to the Dojo script directory
```sh
cd ~/dojo-app/docker/my-dojo
```
### Run "upgrade" command to apply changes
```sh
./dojo.sh upgrade
```
**Note**: any changes made to configuration files will not be applied until you run this upgrade command.

Once you see a constant stream of "node.js", "bitcoind", and "fulcrum" logs, your configuration changes have successfully been applied.

To exit the log screen, go: `ctrl + c`
