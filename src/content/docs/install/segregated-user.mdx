title: Create segregated user
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This step is optional but recommended for security.

Continue copying and pasting the following commands in the terminal, then press `ENTER`.

<Steps>
1. Create a segregated user account called "dojo"
    ```sh
    sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/dojo -m -G sudo dojo
    ```

2. Generate a secure password

    Ideally, using a password manager (like Bitwarden or KeePassXC), generate a long and secure password for the "dojo" user account. Be sure to save it, and/or write it down in a notepad if you are not setting up your Wallet Server on a remote machine (as you will need to login using these credentials in a later step).

3. Set the password for the "dojo" user
    ```sh
    sudo passwd dojo
    ```
    Then paste / type the password generated in the previous step.

4. Add your "dojo" user account to the Docker group
    ```sh
    sudo usermod -aG docker dojo
    ```

5. Reboot your machine to apply the changes
    ```sh
    sudo reboot
    ```

6. Log back into your machine using the "dojo" user

    After your machine has rebooted, login using "dojo" as the user, and enter the password you generated earlier.
